A tree is a hierarchical data structure made up of nodes, where:

- The top node is called the root.
- Each node contains a value and references to child nodes
- A node with no children is called a leaf.
- Every node (except the root) has one parent.
- Trees do not contain cycles (theyâ€™re acyclic).

Common types:

- Binary Tree: Each node has at most two children.
- Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree with ordered values (left < root < right).
- AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree: Self-balancing binary search trees.
- Trie: Tree used for storing strings (prefix trees).
- Heap: Tree-based structure used for priority queues.
