## What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order. The most common sorting orders are:

- **Ascending order**: From smallest to largest.
- **Descending order**: From largest to smallest.

Sorting algorithms help organize data, making searching and other operations more efficient.

## Common Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort
   Concept: Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The largest element "bubbles" up to its correct position with each pass through the list.

Time Complexity: O(n²) in the worst case.

Best Use: Educational tool or when simplicity is needed (not efficient for large datasets).

2. Selection Sort
   Concept: Selection Sort divides the list into two parts: sorted and unsorted. It repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
   Time Complexity: O(n²) in all cases.
   Best Use: Simple to understand, but not efficient for large lists.

3. Insertion Sort
   Concept: Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position relative to the already sorted elements.

Time Complexity: O(n²) in the worst case, O(n) in the best case (if the array is already sorted).

Best Use: Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted data.
