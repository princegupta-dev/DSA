// Candy
/*
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

Constraints:

n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

*/

function candy(ratings) {
  const n = ratings.length;
  const candies = Array(n).fill(1); // Step 1: Each child starts with 1 candy
  // Step 2: Left-to-right pass
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
      candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
    }
  }
  // Step 3: Right-to-left pass
  for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
      candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
    }
  }

  // Step 4: Return the total candies
  return candies.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}

const ratings1 = [1, 0, 2];
console.log(candy(ratings1));
